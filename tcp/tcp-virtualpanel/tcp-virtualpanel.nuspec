    <description>Total Commander file system plugin that provides temporary panel.

See [TCP Scripts](https://chocolatey.org/packages/tcps) for package parameters and other notes.

VirtualPanel is a sort of virtual folder that allows keeping links to frequently used files and accessing them as if they were real files and not just links. It doesn't store any files, it only keeps links to them in special list files. You can use VP as a temporary place for files that should be copied to some other place. Also you can use it for organizing media libraries and for other needs. You can even set up some folder for collecting files from multiple folders on your PC.
