Total Commander packer plugin that creates a list file with all selected files and directories, including subdirs - but also lists contents of archive files internally and also lists all the other archive files recognised by installed TC plugins.

You can choose which archive types to list and whether to try to determine unknown archive type using installed TC plugins.

It creates plain text list files which can be opened in Word, Excel or other office tools which can format TAB-delimited files, and then be formatted for printing. It can also be used as a catalog tool: You can scan your CDs with it,each to a file, and then search in these catalogs using the Search command with the option "Search in archives".

See [TCP Scripts](https://chocolatey.org/packages/tcps) for package parameters and other notes.
