    <summary>An easy-to-use Windows interface for pass</summary>
    <description>Pass-winmenu follows the philosophy of (and is compatible with) the Linux password manager pass, which defines an open standard for password management that's easy to extend and customise to your personal requirements.

## Features

- Cryptography is handled by GPG.
- The directory structure for passwords is intuitive and allows you to organise your passwords with your file manager.
- Because the passwords are simply stored in a directory tree, it's easy to synchronise your password store using any version control software of your choosing, giving you synchronisation, file history, and redundancy
- The password files are always encrypted and can only be decrypted with your private GPG key, which is secured with a passphrase.
