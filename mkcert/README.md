# [mkcert](https://chocolatey.org/packages/mkcert)

`mkcert` is a simple CLI tool for making locally-trusted development certificates. It requires no configuration.

`mkcert` automatically creates and installs a local CA in the system root store, and generates locally-trusted certificates. mkcert does not automatically configure servers to use the certificates, though, that's up to you.

```sh
$ mkcert -install
Created a new local CA at "/Users/filippo/Library/Application Support/mkcert" üí•
The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ‚ö°Ô∏è
The local CA is now installed in the Firefox trust store (requires restart)! ü¶ä

$ mkcert example.com "*.example.org" myapp.dev localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
Using the local CA at "/Users/filippo/Library/Application Support/mkcert" ‚ú®

Created a new certificate valid for the following names üìú
 - "example.com"
 - "*.example.org"
 - "myapp.dev"
 - "localhost"
 - "127.0.0.1"
 - "::1"

The certificate is at "./example.com+5.pem" and the key at "./example.com+5-key.pem" ‚úÖ
```
