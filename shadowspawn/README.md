# [shadowspawn](https://chocolatey.org/packages/shadowspawn)

ShadowSpawn is a tool for working with shadow copies. Shadow copies are read-only snapshots of your disk. Working with shadow copies instead of the actual files allows you to do things like work with in-use (locked) files.

ShadowSpawn works by making a shadow copy of your disk, making it available at a drive letter, then launching (spawning) another program that you specify.

Probably the most common way to use ShadowSpawn is to use Robocopy make a copy of files that are currently in use.
